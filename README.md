## Quick Start

### Local Development (Testing Backend Changes)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Configure to use local backend
echo "VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000" > .env

# 3. Start dev server
npm run dev

# 4. Make sure backend is running on localhost:8000
```

### Production Mode

```bash
# 1. Configure to use Railway backend
echo "VITE_API_URL=https://web-production-9c58.up.railway.app" > .env

# 2. Start dev server (or deploy to Vercel)
npm run dev
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Environment Configuration

The frontend uses `.env` to determine which backend to connect to:

```bash
# Local development
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Production (Railway)
VITE_API_URL=https://web-production-9c58.up.railway.app
```

**Critical:** After changing `.env`, you MUST restart the dev server (Ctrl+C, then `npm run dev`)

### Common Mistake

If you're testing backend changes locally but the browser shows old behavior:
1. Check `.env` - it might be pointing to Railway instead of localhost
2. Restart the dev server after changing `.env`
3. Hard refresh the browser (Cmd+Shift+R)
